# MultiClip
If you want to copy many lines (Strings) in your Clipboard, you can use this program to move in different items with hotkeys combination. The different items are delimited by new line character ('\n').

You must write into great TextBox, then you must push in button 'Refrescar'. You can move item to right if you type 'Ctrl + Alt + A'. You can move item to left if you type 'Ctrl + Alt + D'. Each item is saved in your clipboard automatically.

I attach screenshots of the program MultiClip. If you want to export python code, I will recommend that you will use 'Auto-Py-To-Exe'.
